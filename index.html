    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the black box, there are multiple containers being filled and then poured out at different times.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a system that pours out random amounts of water when water is poured in. Our initial observations showed that there were trials where little amounts of water would come out, and then one where a lot would come out. </p>
