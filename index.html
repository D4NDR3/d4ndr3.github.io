    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the black box, there are multiple containers being filled and then poured out at different times.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a system that pours out random amounts of water when water is poured in. Our initial observations showed that there were trials where 
      little amounts of water would come out, and then one where a lot would come out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part 1</h1>
    <p>The model represents the model that our group made. It allows people to better understand how our model works. The only limitations there are is 
      that the digital model can’t be tested, and there isn't a 3-dimensional perspective</p>
    <h1>Reasoning part 2</h1>
    <p>Since our model was able to replicate the black box’s data, it supports my claim because the amount of water that came out was different every time,
      just like the black box</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part 3</h1>
    <p>If my claim was different like having a single tube, my data would've been entirely different, and wouldn’t line up with what the blackbox did.</p>
